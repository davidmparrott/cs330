estimating pi.

Description:
In this program I use four different methods to approximate pi. I use the composite forms of the trapezoidal, simpson's 1/3 and simpson's 3/8 rules as well as boole's rule. with these approximations I then find the error in this calculation by comparing it to a predetermined value of pi.

compile and run:
gcc -std=c99 estpi.c -o estpi     //compile
./estpi	     	     		  //run

it will output a 5 column table with the value of n and the error term of each method to stdout.
